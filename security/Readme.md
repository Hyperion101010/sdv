There are 4 aspects:
1. Hardening using Ansible: Using Openstack's Ansible-Hardening.
2. Checking File Permissions: Use the rhosp-sechar-checks.py file.
3. Manual Checking: Manually complete the checking as described in manual-checklist.xlsx
4. Testing: Using the tools 'Syntribos', 'cypherscan' and 'AIDE' (https://aide.github.io/) to perform the testing.

These 4 many not fully cover the guidelines mentioned in:
